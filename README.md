> ‚ÄºÔ∏èThis is a **demo** implementation of the *Simplex Algorithm*, homework of the *Operations Research* class. ***Bugs are expected***.‚ÄºÔ∏è

## Installation

Install via PyPI:
```
$ pip install sapro
```

## CLI Usage

`sapro` expores a command-line interface.
```
$ sapro solve --max x1+2*x2 \
    -c"x1+x2<=4" \
    -c"-2*x1+x2<=1" \
    -c"x1<=3" \
    --slack x3
z = 7 when x1 = 1, x2 = 3, x3 = 0, x4 = 0, x5 = 2
```

Run `python -m sapro solve -h` for more info.

## GUI Usage

`sapro` exposes a demo web GUI using `wsgiref`. To launch the WSGI server, use the following command:
```
$ sapro webui --open
Serving on 0.0.0.0:5678...
Press Ctrl+C to quit.
```

Open `http://localhost:5678` in your browser to use the interface.

To use a custom host and port, specify the `-H` and `-p` arguments:
```
$ python -m sapro -H 127.0.0.1 -p 8080
```

## API Usage

To use `sapro` in your program, you can import the `sapro` module.
```py
from sapro import *
```

### Variables

Variables are defined using the `Variable` class:
```py
x1 = Variable("x1")
```

I recommend using the same **python** variable name as the variable itself.

To conveniently define a series of variables e.g. $x_1$ ~ $x_4$ you can use the `sequence` method on `Variable`:
```py
x1, x2, x3, x4 = Variable.sequence('x', 4)
```

You can also omit the last parameter to create a "variable generator":
```py
x = Variable.sequence('x')
x1 = next(x)
x2 = next(x)
```

This is useful when you want to continue using the variable prefix for *slack variables*.

### Expressions

Expressions are created in a manner as if you are defining them in python:
```py
expr = -x1 + 2*x2
double_expr = 2 * expr
print(double_expr) # -2x1 + 4x2
```

Note that the multiplication sign (`*`) is omitted when printed, but is necessary in the expression definition.

Because this is a LP solver, only linear addition of the variables are allowed.

### Constraints

Constraints are created in a manner as if you are comparing an expression to a constant in python:
```py
cons = (-2*x1 + x2 <= 1)
print(cons) # -2x1 + x2 <= 1

cons.canonicalize(Variable("x3"))
print(cons) # -2x1 + x2 + x3 == 1
```

The right hand side of a constraint **must** be a single number. Only operators that permits equality are allowed (`<=`, `==` and `>=`).

### Define LP Problem

To define a LP problem, use the `Simplex` class.

Here is a simple LP problem. You can probably answer it in your head:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\max \space & x_1 + 2x_2 \\
\text{s.t.} \space & x_1 + x_2 \le 4, \\
& -2x_1 + x_2 \le 1, \\
& x_1 \le 3, \\
& x_i \ge 0, \space i = 1, 2, 3
\end{aligned}
$$

Its corresponding definition in python:
```py
x = Variable.sequence('x')
x1, x2 = next(x), next(x)

problem = Simplex(
    # max
    x1 + 2*x2,
    # s.t.
    x1 + x2 <= 4,
    -2*x1 + x2 <= 1,
    x1 >= 3,

    maximize=True,
    slack_var_generator=x
)
```

Pretty much the same, right? Here's what happened:

- The first positional argument is an expression of what the LP problem should optimize.
- The rest of the positional arguments are the constraints.
- `maximize=True` tells the algorithm to **maximize** instead of minimizing the target, which is the default behaviour.
- `slack_var_generator=x` tells the algorithm to continue using the generator `x` to generate slack variables. In this case, since `x1` and `x2` are consumed from the generator, slack variables will start their names from `x3`. If you omit this parameter, slack variables will have the prefix `s`, unless you specify the parameter `slack_var_prefix`.

The intrinsic bounds $x_i \ge 0$ always take effect. You don't need to explicitly specify them.

### Solving LP Problem

To solve a LP problem using simplex, the first thing to do is to determine the *base variables*. There are three ways to do this:

-   Select *slack variables* as base. This would be the most straightforward way for problems whose constraints are all **inequations**. After adding slack variables, their coefficient in the constraints are naturally 1 or -1, which composes a inversible matrix.
    
    No code is needed to use this method, as this is the default approach used by the algorithm. But you need to make sure that there is enough slack variables for the base i.e. all constraints are inequations.

-   Use the Two-Phase algorithm. This approach is suitable for normal LP problems.
    ```py
    from sapro.error import LPError

    try:
        # the method returns a generator
        # we need to consume all elements
        # to complete the algorithm
        list(problem.two_phase())
        print('feasible solution:')
        print(problem.result)
    except LPError as e:
        print('unsolvable problem:', e)
    ```

-   Manually specify the bases. Make sure the number of base variables matches the number of constraints.
    ```py
    problem.set_base_vars([x1, x2, x3]) # a list of variables
    ```

Now use the `solve` method to solve the problem:
```py
from sapro.error import LPError

try:
    # the method returns a generator
    # we need to consume all elements
    # to complete the algorithm
    list(problem.solve())
    print('best solution:')
    print(problem.result)
except LPError as e:
    print('unsolvable problem:', e)
```

### Per-Step Simplex Tableau

You may notice that we haven't used the generator returned by `Simplex.two_phase` and `Simplex.solve`. They yield `LPStep` objects, which has 3 fields:

- `tableau`: The simplex tableau after the current step.
- `enter`: The variable that became base.
- `leave`: The variable that left base.

Example of print the tableau:
```py
for i, step in enumerate(problem.solve()):
    print(f'Step {i+1}: ({step.enter} enters, {step.leave} leaves)')
    print(step.tableau)
```

If you pass `yield_initial_tableau=True` to either of the two methods, then an table containing the initial data will be yielded, before any variable has entered / left the base.

For more detailed usage, refer to the in-code documentations.
